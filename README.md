# RISC-V Single Cycle CPU in Verilog HDL

## Overview

This project presents the design and implementation of a **32-bit Single Cycle RISC-V Processor** using **Verilog HDL** in **Xilinx Vivado**. The processor follows a modular hardware design methodology where each functional block is implemented as an independent Verilog module and then integrated into a complete CPU datapath.

The processor executes instructions in **one clock cycle per instruction**, meaning fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back all occur within a single cycle.

This project demonstrates fundamental processor architecture concepts including:

* Instruction Fetch
* Program Counter Control
* Instruction Decode
* Register File Operations
* Immediate Generation
* Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
* Branch Decision Logic
* Data Memory Access
* Write Back Stage

---

# Project Objective

The objective of this project is to build a working RISC-V CPU core from scratch to understand internal processor operation at RTL level.

This project helps in learning:

* Computer Architecture
* CPU Datapath Design
* Control Unit Logic
* Verilog HDL Coding
* Simulation and Verification
* FPGA Design Flow using Vivado

# Single Cycle Architecture

In this processor, each instruction completes in one clock cycle.

## Instruction Flow

```text
Fetch → Decode → Execute → Memory → Writeback
```

All five operations occur in one cycle.
